This file contains all the interactive functionality for our story.
JavaScript makes our story come alive by handling:
- Moving between scenes when users click buttons

- Playing audio and handling user interactions

Think of JavaScript as the "director" of our story - it tells all the parts (HTML and CSS) what to do and when to do it.
